## Remote Audio: FIXED

**Branch:** `fix/av-audio-autoplay`
**PR:** https://github.com/lstep/PixelEruv/pull/16
**Status:** Audio works across mixed browsers (Safari + Chrome, different machines). Two fixes were needed.

## Root Causes & Fixes

### Fix 1: RED codec incompatibility (Safari)
The LiveKit SDK enables `audio/red` (Redundant Audio Data) by default for mono audio tracks. Safari cannot decode `audio/red` — only `audio/opus`. Chrome-published audio was silent on Safari.

**Fix:** `publishDefaults: { red: false }` in the Room constructor (`AvClient.connect()`). Forces `audio/opus` for all published audio tracks.

### Fix 2: Remote audio tracks never attached (the real blocker)
LiveKit does NOT auto-attach remote audio tracks to `<audio>` elements. `addSubscribedMediaTrack` creates a `RemoteAudioTrack` but never calls `attach()`. Without an attached element:
- `setVolume()` was a no-op (iterates `attachedElements` which was empty)
- `startAudio()` was a no-op (plays `attachedElements` which was empty)
- `isSpeaking` worked (analyzed from RTP packets) but no sound played

For video, `VideoTile.attachTrack()` manually calls `track.attach(videoElement)`. Nobody did the equivalent for audio.

**Fix:** In the `TrackSubscribed` handler, when an audio track arrives, call `audioTrack.attach()` to create a hidden `<audio>` element with `autoplay=true`, then call `room.startAudio()` to start playback.

## What Works (confirmed)

- LiveKit signaling connects
- WebRTC ICE succeeds (UDP, public IP via `use_external_ip`)
- Both participants publish audio + video tracks
- Video renders correctly on both sides
- Audio plays with spatial distance-based volume
- Green speaking border appears on both local and remote tiles
- Cross-browser: Safari + Chrome, different machines

## What's Been Done (commits on the branch)

1. **Fix remote audio playback blocked by browser autoplay policy**
   - `AvAudioBlockedHandler` + `onAudioBlocked` property
   - `startAudio()` method, "Enable Audio" button in TopMenu
   - Same-room skip + leave debounce (1.5s) in `handleTokenFrame`

2. **Enable LiveKit use_external_ip for remote WebRTC access**
   - `livekit.yaml`: `use_external_ip: true`

3. **Unlock audio on first page click via silent audio element**
   - Constructor installs one-time `document.click` listener
   - Plays a silent 1-byte WAV to unlock Safari autoplay

4. **Add mic/camera device selection in the menu dropdown**
   - `AvClient.getDevices(kind)`, `AvClient.switchDevice(kind, deviceId)`
   - TopMenu dropdown has mic + camera `<select>` dropdowns

5. **Persist selected device IDs across room reconnects**

6. **Disable RED codec** (`publishDefaults: { red: false }`)

7. **Attach remote audio tracks on TrackSubscribed** (the actual fix for no sound)

## Noise Cancellation Option

**Branch:** `fix/remote-audio-attach-and-red-codec`
**Status:** Implemented, activated by default. Not yet wired to the TopMenu — toggle via `AvClient.setNoiseCancellation()` for now.

WebRTC client-side noise cancellation (`noiseSuppression` + `echoCancellation` + `autoGainControl`) is now an explicit, persisted option in `AvClient` (localStorage key `av.noiseCancellation`, defaults on). Previously these flags were only set implicitly via the LiveKit SDK's built-in `audioDefaults`.

- `isNoiseCancellationEnabled()` / `setNoiseCancellation(enabled)` — getter/setter, persisted across reconnects.
- `buildAudioCaptureOptions()` — merges the selected mic device ID with the noise-cancellation flags into `AudioCaptureOptions`, applied via `audioCaptureDefaults` at room connect time.
- Mid-call toggle: `setNoiseCancellation` restarts the mic track (`LocalAudioTrack.restartTrack`) so the change takes effect without reconnecting, when the mic is published and unmuted.
- When disabled, the three flags are explicitly set to `false` to override the SDK's `true` defaults.

Note: only WebRTC client-side cancellation applies (self-hosted LiveKit). The enhanced Krisp/ai-coustics models in the LiveKit docs require LiveKit Cloud and target voice AI agents, not browser conferencing clients.

### TODO: split into individual toggles in the options menu

Currently all three flags are controlled by a single `noiseCancellation` boolean. In the future options menu, each should be independently changeable:

- **noiseSuppression** — removes background noise (fans, traffic, etc.)
- **echoCancellation** — removes echo from speakers feeding back into the mic
- **autoGainControl** — normalizes voice volume automatically

This means splitting `noiseCancellation` into three separate persisted booleans (with their own localStorage keys), three getters/setters, and three checkboxes in the TopMenu dropdown.
